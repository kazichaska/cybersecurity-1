**Cybersecurity: Cyber Threat Intelligence and Incident Response Report**

**Incident Name:** [Choose a descriptive name for your incident. Examples: "Suspicious Network Traffic Detected," "Potential Malware Infection," "Unauthorized Access Attempt"]

**Report Author:** [Your Name]

**Report Date:** [Current Date]

**1. What was the indicator of attack?**

* Clearly state what initially triggered your investigation. This could be:
    * A specific alert from your NSM system (e.g., Snort, OSSEC).
    * Unusual network traffic patterns.
    * Suspicious log entries.
    * User reports of abnormal system behavior.
    * Be specific, include timestamps, IP addresses, usernames, file names etc.

**2. What was the adversarial motivation (purpose of attack)?**

* Based on your investigation, what do you believe the attacker's goal was? Consider these possibilities:
    * Data exfiltration (what type of data?).
    * System disruption (DDoS, ransomware).
    * Gaining persistent access.
    * Espionage.
    * Financial gain.

**3. What were the adversaryâ€™s actions and tactics?**

* Describe the attacker's actions and categorize them according to the Cyber Kill Chain or MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    * **Reconnaissance:**
        * What information did the attacker gather? (e.g., port scans, website enumeration, social engineering).
    * **Weaponization:**
        * What tools or techniques were used to create the attack? (e.g., malware development, exploit creation).
    * **Delivery:**
        * How was the attack delivered? (e.g., email attachment, malicious website, USB drive).
    * **Exploitation:**
        * What vulnerabilities were exploited? (e.g., software flaws, misconfigurations).
    * **Installation:**
        * How was the malware or backdoor installed? (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).
    * **Command and Control (C2):**
        * How did the attacker communicate with the compromised system? (e.g., C2 server, IRC, DNS tunneling).
    * **Actions on Objectives:**
        * What actions did the attacker take after gaining access? (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement, privilege escalation).
    * Include any log snippets, screenshots, or tool outputs that support your findings.

**4. What are your recommended mitigation strategies?**

* Provide specific recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future. Consider these areas:
    * Endpoint security (antivirus, EDR, application whitelisting).
    * Network security (firewalls, IDS/IPS, network segmentation).
    * Email security (filtering, training).
    * Data security (encryption, DLP, access controls).
    * User training and awareness.
    * Patch management.
    * Incident response improvements.
    * Configuration changes.
    * Policy updates.

**5. List your third-party references.**

* Cite any sources you used for your investigation, such as:
    * MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    * Cyber Kill Chain.
    * Vendor documentation.
    * Threat intelligence reports.
    * Security blogs or articles.
    * OSSEC Documentation.
    * Snort Documentation.

**Key Tips:**

* **Be detailed:** Provide as much detail as possible to support your findings.
* **Use evidence:** Include log snippets, screenshots, and other evidence to back up your claims.
* **Be specific:** Avoid vague statements and provide concrete examples.
* **Be actionable:** Your mitigation strategies should be practical and implementable.
* **Be organized:** Use a clear and logical structure to present your findings.
