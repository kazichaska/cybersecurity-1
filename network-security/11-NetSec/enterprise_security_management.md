# Enterprise Security Management

Enterprise security management involves using various tools and techniques to monitor, analyze, and respond to security threats within an organization. This document outlines key practices and examples for effective enterprise security management.

## Analyze Indicators of Attack for Persistent Threats

Indicators of Attack (IOA) are signs that an attack is in progress or has occurred. Analyzing IOAs helps identify persistent threats and understand their behavior.

- **Example**: Using Security Onion to monitor network traffic and identify patterns indicative of a persistent threat.
  ```bash
  sudo so-status
  ```

## Use Enterprise Security Management to Expand an Investigation

Enterprise security management tools provide a comprehensive view of the organization's security posture, enabling analysts to expand investigations and uncover additional details.

- **Example**: Using Splunk to correlate logs from different sources and identify related events.
  ```bash
  splunk search "index=main sourcetype=access_combined"
  ```

## Use OSSEC Endpoint Reporting Agents as Part of a Host-Based IDS Alert System

OSSEC is an open-source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that uses endpoint reporting agents to monitor and analyze system activity.

- **Example**: Installing OSSEC agents on endpoints to collect and report security events to the OSSEC server.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ossec-hids-agent
  sudo /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
  ```

## Investigate Threats Using Various Analysis Tools

Investigating threats requires using a variety of analysis tools to gather and analyze data from different sources.

- **Example**: Using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic for signs of malicious activity.
  ```bash
  sudo wireshark
  ```
- **Example**: Using Kibana to visualize and analyze log data from Security Onion.
  ```bash
  sudo so-kibana
  ```

## Escalate Alerts to Senior Incident Handlers

When a significant threat is identified, it is important to escalate the alert to senior incident handlers for further investigation and response.

- **Example**: Using an incident management system like TheHive to escalate alerts and track incident response activities.
  ```bash
  curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"title": "New Incident", "description": "Details of the incident"}' http://thehive.example.com/api/case
  ```

## Conclusion

Effective enterprise security management involves analyzing indicators of attack, using various tools to investigate threats, and escalating alerts to senior incident handlers. By implementing these practices, organizations can enhance their security posture and respond to threats more effectively.

# Enterprise Security Management

Enterprise security management involves using various tools and techniques to monitor, analyze, and respond to security threats within an organization. This document outlines key practices and examples for effective enterprise security management.

## Analyze Indicators of Attack for Persistent Threats

- **Example**: Using Security Onion to monitor network traffic and identify patterns indicative of a persistent threat.
  ```bash
  sudo so-status
  ```
- **Example**: Reviewing logs for unusual login attempts, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network.

## Use Enterprise Security Management to Expand an Investigation

Enterprise security management tools provide a comprehensive view of the organization's security posture, enabling analysts to expand investigations and uncover additional details.

- **Example**: Using Splunk to correlate logs from different sources and identify related events.
  ```bash
  splunk search "index=main sourcetype=access_combined"
  ```
- **Example**: Leveraging SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems to aggregate and analyze security data from across the enterprise.

## Use OSSEC Endpoint Reporting Agents as Part of a Host-Based IDS Alert System

OSSEC is an open-source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that uses endpoint reporting agents to monitor and analyze system activity.

- **Example**: Installing OSSEC agents on endpoints to collect and report security events to the OSSEC server.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ossec-hids-agent
  sudo /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
  ```
- **Example**: Configuring OSSEC to monitor critical system files, user activity, and network connections for signs of compromise.

## Investigate Threats Using Various Analysis Tools

Investigating threats requires using a variety of analysis tools to gather and analyze data from different sources.

- **Example**: Using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic for signs of malicious activity.
  ```bash
  sudo wireshark
  ```
- **Example**: Using Kibana to visualize and analyze log data from Security Onion.
  ```bash
  sudo so-kibana
  ```
- **Example**: Employing forensic tools like Autopsy to analyze disk images and recover deleted files.

## Escalate Alerts to Senior Incident Handlers

When a significant threat is identified, it is important to escalate the alert to senior incident handlers for further investigation and response.

- **Example**: Using an incident management system like TheHive to escalate alerts and track incident response activities.
  ```bash
  curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"title": "New Incident", "description": "Details of the incident"}' http://thehive.example.com/api/case
  ```
- **Example**: Notifying senior incident handlers via email or messaging platforms with detailed information about the threat and recommended actions.

## Conclusion

Effective enterprise security management involves analyzing indicators of attack, using various tools to investigate threats, and escalating alerts to senior incident handlers. By implementing these practices, organizations can enhance their security posture and respond to threats more effectively.
