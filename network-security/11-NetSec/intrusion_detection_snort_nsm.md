# Introduction to Intrusion Detection with Snort and NSM

## 1. Interpret and Define Snort Rules and Alerts

Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that uses a rule-based language to define traffic patterns and generate alerts. Snort rules consist of two main parts: the rule header and the rule options.

- **Rule Header**: Specifies the action, protocol, source IP, source port, destination IP, and destination port.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 80 (msg:"Possible web attack"; sid:1000001;)
    ```
  - **Explanation**: This rule generates an alert for any TCP traffic from any source IP and port to the destination IP range `192.168.1.0/24` on port 80.

- **Rule Options**: Provide additional details and conditions for the rule.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 80 (msg:"Possible web attack"; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:1000001;)
    ```
  - **Explanation**: This rule generates an alert for any TCP traffic containing the HTTP GET method to the destination IP range `192.168.1.0/24` on port 80.

## 2. Explain How Intrusion Detection Systems Work and How They Differ from Firewalls

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and generate alerts when potential threats are detected. IDS can be classified into two types: Network-based IDS (NIDS) and Host-based IDS (HIDS).

- **NIDS**: Monitors network traffic for multiple devices.
- **HIDS**: Monitors traffic and activities on a single host.

### Differences Between IDS and Firewalls

- **IDS**: Detects and alerts on suspicious activity but does not block traffic.
- **Firewalls**: Control and filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

## 3. Use Security Onion and Its Suite of Network Security Monitoring Tools to Trace the Path of Network Attacks

Security Onion is a Linux distribution for intrusion detection, network security monitoring (NSM), and log management. It includes tools like Snort, Suricata, Bro (Zeek), and Elasticsearch.

### Steps to Trace Network Attacks

1. **Deploy Security Onion**: Install and configure Security Onion on your network.
2. **Monitor Traffic**: Use tools like Snort and Suricata to monitor network traffic.
3. **Analyze Alerts**: Review alerts generated by Snort and Suricata to identify potential attacks.
4. **Trace Path**: Use tools like Bro (Zeek) and Elasticsearch to trace the path of the attack and gather detailed information.

## 4. Collect and Analyze Indicators of Attack (IOA) and Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Using NSM Tools

Indicators of Attack (IOA) and Indicators of Compromise (IOC) are pieces of evidence that suggest a network has been attacked or compromised.

### Collecting and Analyzing IOA and IOC

1. **Use NSM Tools**: Utilize tools like Snort, Suricata, and Bro (Zeek) to collect network traffic data.
2. **Identify IOA and IOC**: Look for patterns and anomalies in the collected data that indicate potential attacks or compromises.
3. **Analyze Data**: Use tools like Kibana and Elasticsearch to analyze and visualize the data for better understanding and response.

## 5. Apply Knowledge of NSM, Snort Rules, and Security Onion to Establish Situational Awareness Within a Network

Situational awareness involves understanding the current security posture of your network and identifying potential threats.

### Steps to Establish Situational Awareness

1. **Deploy Security Onion**: Set up Security Onion to monitor your network.
2. **Define Snort Rules**: Create and customize Snort rules to detect specific threats relevant to your network.
3. **Monitor and Analyze**: Continuously monitor network traffic and analyze alerts using Security Onion's suite of tools.
4. **Respond to Threats**: Use the insights gained from monitoring and analysis to respond to and mitigate potential threats.

By following these steps, you can effectively use NSM tools, Snort rules, and Security Onion to maintain situational awareness and enhance the security of your network.
