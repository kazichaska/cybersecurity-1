# Security Onion

Security Onion is a comprehensive, open-source platform for intrusion detection, network security monitoring (NSM), and log management. It integrates various tools to provide a robust solution for monitoring and analyzing network traffic.

## Key Features and Examples

### Performs Simple Aggregation of Alert Data Records

Security Onion aggregates alert data from multiple sources, providing a consolidated view of potential threats.

- **Example**: Aggregating alerts from Snort, Suricata, and Zeek (Bro) into a single dashboard for easy analysis.
  ```bash
  sudo so-status
  ```

### Makes Available Certain Types of Metadata

Security Onion captures and makes available various types of metadata, such as IP addresses, protocols, and timestamps, which are essential for detailed analysis.

- **Example**: Viewing metadata for a specific alert in the Kibana dashboard.
  ```bash
  sudo so-kibana
  ```

### Allows Queries and Review of Alert Data

Security Onion allows users to query and review alert data to identify and investigate potential threats.

- **Example**: Using the Kibana interface to search for specific alerts based on criteria such as source IP, destination IP, or alert message.
  ```bash
  sudo so-kibana
  ```

### Allows Queries and Review of Session Data

Security Onion enables users to query and review session data, providing insights into the communication patterns and behaviors of network devices.

- **Example**: Using Zeek (Bro) logs to review session data and identify unusual activity.
  ```bash
  sudo so-zeek
  ```

### Allows Easy Transitions Between Alert or Session Data and Full Content Data

Security Onion facilitates seamless transitions between different types of data, allowing users to move from high-level alerts or session data to detailed packet captures for in-depth analysis.

- **Example**: Clicking on an alert in the Kibana dashboard to view the corresponding full packet capture in the PCAP interface.
  ```bash
  sudo so-pcap
  ```

### Counts and Classifies Events, Enabling Escalation and Other Incident Response Decisions

Security Onion counts and classifies events, helping security analysts prioritize and escalate incidents based on their severity and impact.

- **Example**: Using the Elasticsearch backend to classify and count events, and generating reports to support incident response decisions.
  ```bash
  sudo so-elasticsearch
  ```

## Conclusion

Security Onion is a powerful platform that integrates multiple tools to provide comprehensive network security monitoring and analysis. By leveraging its features, security analysts can effectively monitor network traffic, identify potential threats, and respond to incidents in a timely manner.
