# Email Networks and Security

## Validate DNS Records Using nslookup

- **nslookup**: A command-line tool used to query DNS records.
- **Example**: Validate the DNS records for a domain.
  ```bash
  nslookup example.com
  ```
  - **Output**: Displays the IP address associated with the domain.
  ```bash
  Server:  dns.example.com
  Address:  192.168.1.1

  Non-authoritative answer:
  Name:    example.com
  Address: 93.184.216.34
  ```

## Describe the Process, Protocols, and Headers Associated with Email Communication

- **Process**: Email communication involves sending and receiving messages between clients and servers.
  - **Sending**: The email client sends the message to the SMTP server.
  - **Receiving**: The recipient's email server receives the message and stores it until the recipient retrieves it using POP3 or IMAP.
- **Protocols**:
  - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used to send emails.
  - **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)**: Used to retrieve emails from the server.
  - **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**: Used to retrieve and manage emails on the server.
- **Headers**: Contain metadata about the email, such as sender, recipient, subject, and timestamps.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    From: sender@example.com
    To: recipient@example.com
    Subject: Test Email
    Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2021 12:34:56 +0000
    ```

## Analyze Email Headers to Identify Suspicious Content

- **Email Headers**: Provide information about the email's origin, path, and delivery.
- **Example**: Analyzing headers to identify suspicious content.
  - **Received Headers**: Trace the path the email took from sender to recipient.
    ```
    Received: from mail.example.com (mail.example.com [93.184.216.34])
            by recipient.com (Postfix) with ESMTP id 1234567890
            for <recipient@example.com>; Mon, 1 Nov 2021 12:34:56 +0000 (UTC)
    ```
  - **Suspicious Indicators**:
    - **Mismatch in Received Headers**: Check for discrepancies in the originating IP address and domain.
    - **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Failures**: Look for failed authentication checks.
      ```
      Authentication-Results: recipient.com;
                              spf=fail (sender IP is 93.184.216.34) smtp.mailfrom=example.com;
                              dkim=fail header.d=example.com;
                              dmarc=fail (p=REJECT) header.from=example.com
      ```
  - **Unusual Content**: Look for unexpected attachments, links, or content in the email body.
