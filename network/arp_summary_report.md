**Security Assessment Report: ARP Analysis for CompuCorp**

**Prepared by:** Acme Corp Security Analyst  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Target Network:** CompuCorp Internal Network

### **1. Overview**
This report presents the findings of the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) traffic analysis conducted on CompuCorp's network. The objective was to identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks associated with ARP activity.

### **2. Findings**
#### **2.1 Duplicate IP Address Detected**
- The IP address `192.168.47.1` is being used by multiple MAC addresses:
  - **00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1** (VMware)
  - **00:50:56:c0:00:08** (VMware)
- This indicates a possible **IP conflict or ARP spoofing attempt**.
- Duplicate IP detection can lead to:
  - **Network disruptions** due to conflicting responses.
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**, where an attacker intercepts network traffic.

#### **2.2 ARP Spoofing Indicators**
- **Multiple unsolicited ARP replies** were observed.
- If an attacker is injecting fake ARP replies, they could:
  - Redirect traffic intended for `192.168.47.1`.
  - Capture sensitive data such as login credentials.
  - Conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by causing network instability.

### **3. Recommendations for Mitigation**
To mitigate the risks associated with ARP spoofing and duplicate IP conflicts, CompuCorp should implement the following security measures:

#### **3.1 Implement Static ARP Entries**
For critical devices (e.g., gateway, DNS server), configure static ARP mappings to prevent spoofing.
```bash
arp -s 192.168.47.1 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1
```

#### **3.2 Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**
If the network uses **managed switches**, enable DAI to monitor ARP traffic and block suspicious activity.

#### **3.3 Monitor ARP Tables and Logs**
Regularly inspect ARP tables for inconsistencies:
```bash
arp -a
```
Deploy network monitoring tools like **Arpwatch** or **XArp** to detect anomalies.

#### **3.4 Network Segmentation**
Use VLANs to separate trusted systems from untrusted devices, reducing exposure to ARP poisoning attacks.

### **4. Conclusion**
The presence of duplicate IP addresses and unsolicited ARP replies indicates potential security vulnerabilities. Immediate actions should be taken to investigate the source of the duplicate IP conflict and implement mitigation strategies to protect against ARP-based attacks.

For further assessment, Acme Corp recommends continuous network monitoring and periodic security audits to ensure a secure network environment.
