Here's an Ansible playbook designed to automate the tasks you've described for Windows servers or workstations that are domain-joined. This playbook leverages PowerShell commands to collect data on user permissions, potential malware hiding spots, high CPU processes, and services. It then compiles a report for each machine.

### Instructions:
1. **Inventory Setup:**  
   Ensure your Ansible inventory (`hosts` file) includes `windows_servers` with WinRM configured.

2. **Run the Playbook:**  
   Execute with:  
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory windows_audit_playbook.yml
   ```

3. **Report Location:**  
   After execution, reports will be stored in `./audit_reports` on your control machine.
