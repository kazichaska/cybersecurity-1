## 🧠 How to Think Like a Pentester — Step by Step

---

### 🔍 1. **Start with the Basics: What is the system exposing?**

From Nmap, focus on:
- **Open Ports**
- **Running Services (and versions)**
- **Operating System**
- **Uptime / Hostname / MAC (Vendor info)**

> 💡 Think: "What can I touch? What software is running? Is it old or unpatched?"

---

### 🧭 2. **Check for Known Exploits (CVE Search)**

For each open service, Google or search on sites like:
- [https://cvedetails.com](https://cvedetails.com)
- [https://exploit-db.com](https://exploit-db.com)
- `searchsploit` (Kali tool)
- ChatGPT 😎

> ✍️ Example:  
> `Apache httpd 2.4.25` → vulnerable to **multiple CVEs**, like CVE-2017-5638 (Struts2), etc.

---

### 🔓 3. **Think Like an Attacker: What can I abuse?**

Ask yourself:
- **Can I get shell access?**
  - via web app exploit? (RCE, LFI, file upload?)
  - via SSH brute-force?
- **Can I escalate privileges?**
  - `sudo` version, SUID binaries, kernel exploits?
- **Any misconfigurations?**
  - Web directory listing, default creds, hidden pages, robots.txt?
- **Any known backdoors or weak crypto?**
  - VSFTPD backdoor, outdated SSL, Heartbleed, Log4Shell?

---

### 🕵️ 4. **Use Recon to Build an Attack Tree**

Build this mental map:

```
[Web server on 192.168.13.12:8080]
 └─ Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP 1.1
     ├─ Check for /manager/html
     ├─ Default creds? (tomcat:tomcat)
     ├─ CVE-2017-12615 (PUT file upload)
     └─ WAR deployment? RCE?
```

```
[192.168.13.14:22]
 └─ OpenSSH 7.6p1 (Ubuntu 18.04)
     ├─ Brute-force SSH?
     ├─ Any valid creds from another host?
     └─ Check `sudo -V` for CVE-2019-14287
```

---

### 🛠️ 5. **Use Tools Smartly**

- **Gobuster/Dirb** — enumerate web directories
- **Nikto** — scan for web server misconfig
- **Searchsploit** — find local exploits
- **Metasploit** — automate known attacks
- **BurpSuite** — test session, login, parameters

---

### 🎯 6. **Don’t Ignore the Simple Stuff**

Often in CTFs or real pentests:
- Default passwords
- Open phpMyAdmin, Tomcat manager, Jenkins
- Misconfigured cronjobs or SUID files
- Writable config files with creds

---

### 🧠 Mental Flow Summary

1. What’s open?
2. What version is it?
3. Is it known vulnerable?
4. Can I brute it, guess it, or exploit it?
5. If I get in — can I escalate?

---

### 🧪 Example from Your Scan

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
```

- CVE-2017-12615: PUT method enabled RCE
- Default credentials: tomcat:tomcat
- Check: `/manager/html` or `/host-manager/html`

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5
```

- Try SSH brute force
- If login works, check:
  ```bash
  sudo -V   # Is it < 1.8.28?
  sudo -l   # What can the user run?
  ```
- Then try CVE-2019-14287
