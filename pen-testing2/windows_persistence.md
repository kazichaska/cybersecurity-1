# Windows Persistence

The concept and purpose of persistence is the same in Windows as it is in Linux.  
As a reminder, the purpose of persistence is to establish a continuous method of access to the compromised machine or network in case the initial connection is severed.

There are many techniques to establish persistence in Windows, such as abusing Task Scheduler.  
Scheduled tasks in Windows are similar to cronjobs in Linux; they are programmable tasks that can be executed at a defined interval.

By default, Windows has significantly more default scheduled-task jobs created than Linux.  
This gives the penetration tester an opportunity to blend in with existing scheduled tasks.

You will be using this technique in the upcoming activity.

There are also MITRE techniques for persistence. Refer to the

## MITRE Technique: Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Logon Script (Windows)

In this technique, a pen tester can register a script as a registry key that will execute on startup or login.

## MITRE Technique: Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service

In this technique, a pen tester can modify a service to run an executable on startup.  
- Services are run as SYSTEM by default.  
- Even though services can be abused for privilege escalation, they can also be used for persistence.

## MITRE Technique: Event Triggered Execution: WMI Event Subscription

This technique leverages Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a way of managing Windows machines, to perform an action once a specific event in Windows is triggered.

For example, whenever a logon event is created in Windows (which occurs when a user logs in), use WMI to start a new process (which could be a payload).

## MITRE Technique: Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver

This technique allows the pen tester to replace the executable that is used to display the screensaver with a malicious executable or payload.

These are just some examples of persistence techniques in Windows.
