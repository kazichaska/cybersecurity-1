# Microservices and Web Application Architecture

## Why the Original Paradigm of Monolith Web Application Architecture Evolved to the Microservices Model

Monolithic web application architecture involves building a single, unified application where all components are tightly coupled. As applications grew in complexity, this model faced several challenges, such as difficulty in scaling, maintaining, and deploying. To address these issues, the microservices model evolved.

### Benefits of Microservices

- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, modular services are easier to maintain and update.
- **Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently, reducing the risk of downtime.
- **Flexibility**: Different technologies and languages can be used for different services.

## The Different Components of Web Applications

Web applications consist of various components that work together to deliver functionality to users.

### Example Components

- **Frontend**: The user interface, typically built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic, often implemented using frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Spring.
- **Database**: Stores and retrieves data, using systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
- **API**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend, often using REST or GraphQL.

## Specific Examples of Web Application Components or Stacks

### LAMP Stack

- **Linux**: Operating system
- **Apache**: Web server
- **MySQL**: Database
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language

### MERN Stack

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database
- **Express.js**: Web application framework
- **React**: Frontend library
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime

## The Deployment of Web Application Architecture

Web applications can be deployed using various methods, including cloud services, containerization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

### Example Deployment

- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

## The Database Component of Web Applications and How to Interact with Data

Databases store and retrieve data for web applications. They can be relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL).

### Example

- **Relational Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Non-Relational Database**: MongoDB, Redis

## Understand How Microservice Architecture Delivers More Robust, Reliable, and Repeatable Infrastructure as Code

Microservice architecture allows for the development of small, independent services that can be deployed and managed separately. This approach enhances robustness, reliability, and repeatability.

### Benefits

- **Isolation**: Failures in one service do not affect others.
- **Automation**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible automate deployment and management.
- **Consistency**: Repeatable deployments ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

## Define the Different Services Within a LEMP Stack

The LEMP stack is a popular web application stack that includes:

- **Linux**: Operating system
- **Nginx**: Web server
- **MySQL**: Database
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language

## Create a Website Front-End Using GitHub Copilot AI

GitHub Copilot AI can assist in generating code for building a website front-end.

### Example

- **HTML**:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample website created using GitHub Copilot AI.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

- **CSS**:
  ```css
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 20px;
  }

  h1 {
    color: #333;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  ```

## Describe How Relational Databases Store and Retrieve Data

Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys.

### Example

- **Table**: `users`
  - Columns: `id`, `username`, `password`
  - Rows: Each row represents a user.

## Create SQL Queries to View, Enter, and Delete Data

### View Data

- **Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users;
  ```

### Enter Data

- **Query**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('john_doe', 'password123');
  ```

### Delete Data

- **Query**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
  ```

By understanding these concepts and using these examples, you can gain a solid foundation in microservices and web application architecture, enabling you to build and manage robust web applications.
