Status codes
* 200 codes indicate success.
* 300 codes indicate multiple choices, meaning the server can respond to the request in more than one way.
* 400 codes indicate client errors, meaning the client sent an improperly formatted request.
    * 404 is a common example of a 400 code and indicates that a webpage doesn't exist or can't be accessed.
* 500 codes indicate server errors, meaning the server application failed somehow.

Key Takeaways
We just covered a lot of new information about HTTP requests and responses:
* HTTP requests are sent from an HTTP client to an HTTP server.
* HTTP responses are sent back from the HTTP servers as a response to the client.
* HTTP requests include a request line, request header, and optional request body.
* HTTP responses include a status line, response header, and usually a response body.
* Query parameters allow you to be specific about the parts of a resource you want to send data to or receive data from.
* GET requests ask an HTTP server for resources, such as a whole webpage.
* POST requests send data to an HTTP server's resources, such as login credentials or images for a webpage.
* PUT requests also send data to an HTTP server, but are often used to overwrite resources, such as updating a part of a webpage.
* OPTIONS requests ask an HTTP server to respond with all HTTP methods to which the HTTP server is programmed to respond.
