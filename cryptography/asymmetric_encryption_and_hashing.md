# Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing

## Calculate the Required Number of Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys Based on the Number of People Exchanging Secure Messages

### Symmetric Keys

In symmetric encryption, each pair of users needs a unique key to communicate securely. The number of keys required can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of keys} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]
where \( n \) is the number of people.

- **Example**:
  - For 4 people: 
    \[ \text{Number of keys} = \frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6 \]

### Asymmetric Keys

In asymmetric encryption, each user has a pair of keys (public and private). The number of keys required is:
\[ \text{Number of keys} = 2n \]
where \( n \) is the number of people.

- **Example**:
  - For 4 people:
    \[ \text{Number of keys} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

## Use GPG to Generate Keys, and Encrypt and Decrypt Private Messages

GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a tool for secure communication that uses asymmetric encryption.

### Generate Keys

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gpg --gen-key
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command generates a new GPG key pair (public and private).

### Encrypt a Message

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gpg --encrypt --recipient recipient@example.com message.txt
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command encrypts the file `message.txt` for the recipient with the email `recipient@example.com`.

### Decrypt a Message

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gpg --decrypt encrypted.txt
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command decrypts the file `encrypted.txt` using the recipient's private key.

## Use Hashes to Validate the Integrity of Data

Hashes generate a fixed-size hash value from input data, ensuring data integrity.

### Example Using SHA-256

- **Generate Hash**:
  ```bash
  sha256sum file.txt
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```bash
  2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824  file.txt
  ```

### Validate Hash

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sha256sum -c file.txt.sha256
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command checks the integrity of `file.txt` against the provided hash value in `file.txt.sha256`.

## Use Digital Signatures to Validate the Authenticity of Data

Digital signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of data by using asymmetric encryption.

### Create a Digital Signature

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gpg --sign message.txt
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command creates a digital signature for the file `message.txt`.

### Verify a Digital Signature

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gpg --verify message.txt.gpg
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command verifies the digital signature of the file `message.txt.gpg`.

By understanding and applying these cryptographic techniques, you can enhance the security and integrity of your communications and data.
