## Introduction

The purpose of this penetration testing engagement was to assess the security posture of **Acme Corp's** web application and internal network. The engagement aimed to identify vulnerabilities, evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls, and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate risks.

### Expected Deliverables

1. A detailed report of identified vulnerabilities.
2. Recommendations for remediation.
3. A mapping of actions to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Executive Summary

### Engagement Overview

The penetration test was conducted on **Acme Corp's** web application and internal network. The engagement revealed several critical vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and weak password policies. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and lateral movement within the network.

### Key Findings

1. **SQL Injection**: The login form was vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to bypass authentication.
2. **Weak Password Policies**: Several accounts were found to use weak passwords, making them susceptible to brute-force attacks.
3. **Outdated Software**: The internal network contained systems running outdated software with known vulnerabilities.

### Grading Methodology

| Severity | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical | Exploitation could result in a complete compromise of the system or network. |
| High     | Exploitation could result in significant data loss or unauthorized access.  |
| Medium   | Exploitation could result in limited data loss or unauthorized access.      |
| Low      | Exploitation poses minimal risk to the organization.                       |

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 03/29/2025 10:00 AM | Conducted Nmap scan on 192.168.1.0/24          | Identified open ports       |
| 03/29/2025 10:30 AM | Attempted SQL injection on login form          | Successful                  |
| 03/29/2025 11:00 AM | Delivered payload via email                    | Blocked by anti-virus       |
| 03/29/2025 11:30 AM | Attempted privilege escalation on 192.168.1.10 | Unsuccessful                |

## Executive Narrative

The engagement began with reconnaissance using OSINT techniques to gather information about **Acme Corp's** web application. An Nmap scan was conducted on the internal network, revealing several open ports. The login form of the web application was found to be vulnerable to SQL injection, which was successfully exploited to retrieve user credentials. Attempts to deliver a payload via email were blocked by the organization's anti-virus solution, demonstrating the effectiveness of their defensive measures. Privilege escalation attempts on the internal network were unsuccessful due to patched vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Findings

### Finding 1: SQL Injection

- **Severity**: Critical  
- **Description**: The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and access sensitive data.  
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Navigate to the login page.
  2. Enter the following payload in the username field:  
     ```sql
     ' OR '1'='1
     ```
  3. Observe that authentication is bypassed.  
- **Evidence**:  
  ![SQL Injection Exploit](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=SQL+Injection+Screenshot)  
- **Recommendation**: Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

---

### Finding 2: Weak Password Policies

- **Severity**: High  
- **Description**: Several accounts were found to use weak passwords, making them susceptible to brute-force attacks.  
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Use Hydra to perform a brute-force attack on the SSH service:
     ```bash
     hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.1.10 ssh
     ```
  2. Observe that weak passwords are successfully cracked.  
- **Evidence**:  
  ![Hydra Brute-Force](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Hydra+Brute-Force+Screenshot)  
- **Recommendation**: Enforce strong password policies and implement account lockout mechanisms.

---

### Finding 3: Outdated Software

- **Severity**: Medium  
- **Description**: The internal network contained systems running outdated software with known vulnerabilities.  
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Use Nmap to identify software versions:
     ```bash
     nmap -sV 192.168.1.10
     ```
  2. Cross-reference identified versions with known vulnerabilities.  
- **Evidence**:  
  ![Outdated Software](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Outdated+Software+Screenshot)  
- **Recommendation**: Regularly update and patch systems to address known vulnerabilities.

## MITRE Map

The following table maps the pen tester's actions to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

| Tactic              | Technique                     | Action Taken                                   | Outcome                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Initial Access       | Phishing                     | Delivered payload via email                   | Blocked by anti-virus       |
| Credential Access    | Brute Force                  | Performed brute-force attack on SSH service   | Successful                  |
| Execution            | Exploitation for Client Exec | Exploited SQL injection on login form         | Successful                  |
